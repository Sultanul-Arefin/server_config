Before Begin:
-> sudo swapon --show ( to check if swap available )

Creating a Swap File
-> sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile

#######
If fallocate is not installed or you get an error message saying fallocate failed: Operation not supported then use the following command to create the swap file:
-> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576
#######

Giving Proper Permission:
-> sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

mkswap utility to set up a Linux swap area on the file:
-> sudo mkswap /swapfile

Activating the swap file:
-> sudo swapon /swapfile

To make the change permanent open the /etc/fstab file:
-> sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add this line:
/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0

Verify that the swap is active
-> sudo swapon --show
-> sudo free -h

Adjusting the Swappiness Value
Swappiness is a Linux kernel property that defines how often the system will use the swap space. Swappiness can have a value between 0 and 100. A low value will make the kernel to try to avoid swapping whenever possible, while a higher value will make the kernel to use the swap space more aggressively.

The default swappiness value is 60. You can check the current swappiness value by typing the following command:

-> cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

While the swappiness value of 60 is OK for most Linux systems, for production servers, you may need to set a lower value.

For example, to set the swappiness value to 10, run:
-> sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10

To make this parameter persistent across reboots, append the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
vm.swappiness=10

The optimal swappiness value depends on your system workload and how the memory is being used. You should adjust this parameter in small increments to find an optimal value.




Removing a Swap File

1. Start by deactivating the swap space by:
-> sudo swapoff -v /swapfile

2. Next, remove the swap file entry
 /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 
from the /etc/fstab file.

3. Finally, remove the actual swapfile file
-> sudo rm /swapfile
