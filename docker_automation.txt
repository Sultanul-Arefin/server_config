****Docker****

# Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers.
# Container allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
# stack ( স্তূপ, গাঁঘা )

**** Docer Architecture ****

# DockerFile( describes steps to create a Docker image. It's like a recipe with all ingredients and steps necessary in making your dish )

--> cycle
# Developer -> Dockerfile -> Docker Container or Docker Hub -> Pull Image from Docker Hub to different env to check

# Virtualization vs Containerization

Virtualization: Host OS -> Hypervisor -> Guest -> Apps
Containerization: Host OS -> Container Engine -> lib / bins (dependencies ) -> Apps

# Docker has client-server architecture
-> cli is client -> Docker Daemon ( containers ) is the server
-> all the components of client & server together form the docker engine

# Dockerfile, Docker Image, Docker Containers, Docker Hub/Registry, Docker Client, Docker Server(Daemon), Docker Engine

**** Play with Docker ****
-> https://labs.play-with-docker.com

**** Installation on Linux ****

# Install from docs.docker.com
# docker --version
# docker info ( if docker is running, then it'll show output )
# sudo service docker start (docker started )
# sudo usermod -aG docker usermod ( user add to docker groupd )

# docker images ( all the images )
# docker ps ( list out running containers )
# docker ps -a ( list out all containers )

# docker run image_name (hello_world)( to run a image. if image is not available locally, it'll be pulled from repository )
# service docker stop ( to stop docker )

**** Basic Commands ****

# Basic
> docker version ( info about docker client & server )
> docker -v
> docker info
> docker --help  (examples: docker images --help, docker run --help )
> docker login ( login to hub.docker.com )

# Images
> docker images ( ls of images ) ( docker images --help )
> docker pull ( docker pull nginx ) 
> docker rmi ( to remove an images. docker rmi image_name or image_id )

# Containers
> docker ps ( to see running container, -a to see all containers )
> docker run ( docker run image_name, if unable to find locally, it'll get from repo) ( docker run ubuntu )
( docker run -it ubuntu ) ( now, go to another terminal. type docker ps, it'll show that ubuntu is running )
> docker start ( docker start container_id )
> docker stop ( docker stop container_id )

# Systems 
> docker stats ( details on the running container )
> docker system df ( disk usage of docker )
> docker system prune ( to remove unused data ) (see, docker system prune --help to more )
-> docker system prune -a ( remove all unused container, images etc )


**** Docer Images ****

# Docker Image are templates used to create docker containers
# Container is a running instance of image
# Images stored in registries

# docker images --help
# docker images
# docker pull ubuntu
# docker pull ubuntu:18.04 ( with tags )
# docker images -q ( give images id )
# docker images -f "dangling=false" ( 'f' for filters, provide some filters ) ( dangling images are the images, that are associated with a container or a running container )
# docker images -f "dangling=false" -q
# docker run ubuntu ( by running a image, we actually create a container out of it )
( docker run --name MyUbuntu -it ubuntu bash ) ( start a container with name )
# docker rmi ubuntu ( remove image ) ( if used by a container, it'll be unable to delete. 1st stop the container, then remove the image )
# docker rmi -f ubuntu ( remove forcefully )
# docker inspect image_name | id ( to info about image )
# note: image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other )


**** Containers ****

# Containers are running instances of Docker Images

> docker ps
> docker run ImageName ( docker run hello-world )
> docker start containerName/Id 
> docker stop containerName/Id

> docker pause containerName/Id
> docker unpause containerName/Id

> docker top containerName/Id ( top processes )
> docker stats containerName/Id ( stats of running container )

> docker attach containerName/Id ( to go inside the container )

> docker kill containerName/Id ( kill container, if it's running )
> docker rm containerName/Id ( remove container ) 

> docker history ImageName/Id ( history of a particular image )


**** Run Jenkins On Docker ****

# set jenkins home on Docker volume and host machine ( see later )

> docker pull jenkins
> docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins ( -p expose the port 8080 on the host system which corresponcse to 8080 port for the docker server ) ( exporting port 50000 for jenkins api ) ( image name is jenkins ) ( all the data will be lost when we delete the container with this command )

# Persistent storage for Jenkins_Home
> docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /your/home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins ( --name MyJenkins1, running with a name )
# if you stop, remove & then create this container again old file will be remain same.

# docker volume create myjenkins ( to create a volume )
# docker volume ls ( to see volumes )
# docker volume inspect myjenkins ( details about the volume ) ( mount point is where it is available )( though, it's available in the host machine, we're not able to touch it or change any functions )

# after creating volume,
> docker run --name MyJenkins2 -p 9090:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v myjenkins:/var/jenkins_home jenkins ( giving volume name instead of physical location )

# docker inspect MyJenkins2 ( details about the MyJenkins2 Container ) ( See Mounts, where type is volume & name is sultan )



**** Docker File ****


# Dockerfile: A text file with instructions to build image
Or, Automation of Docker Image Creatin

FROM
RUN ( run gets executed during the building of the image )
CMD ( cmd gets executed only when we create a container out of the image )

Step 1:  Create a file named Dockerfile
> mkdir Dockerfiles && cd Dockerfiles
> touch Dockerfile
> vim Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu # first instructions a docker file starts with FROM. have to give a base image
# If we want to create an empty image, use FROM scratch
MAINTAINER sultan <fahimsultan4@gmail.com> # optional
RUN apt-get update # run this command on the image
CMD ["echo", "Hello world....!from first docker image] # if we want to run something on command line during container creation

> docker build ( to build the image )
> docker build . ( current folder )
> docker build -t myimage1:1.0 . ( tag an image )
