Cloud Computing Some Terminology: High Availability, Fault Tolerant, Scalability, Elasticity

Users -> AWS -> VPC -> Amazon EC2(Compute Power), Amazon RDS(Databae)
      -> Amazon S3(Storage)
						
	      -> VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
	        -> A Virtual Private Cloud is your private section of AWS, where you can place AWS resources, and allow/restrict access to them.

		    -> EC2
			-> Known as Elastic Cloud Compute
			-> It's like a basic computer(or, instance which is a server)
			-> basic computer consists of: CPU(Processing Power), OS, Hard Drive(Local Storage), Network Card(Internet), Firewall, RAM
			-> It's like a web hosting server which is a virtual computer 
			
		    -> RDS
			-> AWS provisioned database service
			-> Database platform provided by Amazon
			-> Customer account info, inventory catalog etc
			-> When customer is very much high, amazon will automatically added extra ec2 as needed in vpc, & all ec2 are connected with same rds(scalibility)
			-> when customers are gone, & no need to use extra ec2 amazon will automatically remove ec2 instances from vpc(elasticity)
			-> EC2 could be accessed from anywhere, anytime ( high availability )
			-> if any damaged occured in any ec2, it'll be automatically redirect to another ec2 ( fault tolerant)
			-> after removing the damaged ec2, amazon will automatically create another ec2 & redirect users again in to the new ec2


    -> Amazon S3(Storage)
	-> It's like Large Unlimited Storage Bucket
	-> Mass Storage
	-> Long-term Storage


AWS Region: Availability zone 1,2,3.... ( Data Center )
